# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions using historical transaction data. The dataset is highly imbalanced and requires careful evaluation using metrics such as recall and ROC-AUC.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering using balance difference variables
- Model comparison between Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Business insights and fraud prevention recommendations

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Outcome
Random Forest performed best in detecting fraudulent transactions while maintaining controlled false positives.
